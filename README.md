# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
In the following analysis, we want to determine if an applicant for a fund will be succesful or not. This will be achieved through the building of a neural network. The neural network will be trained with data collected from over 34,000 organizations from the past who have been funded. The data first was processed before feeding it two our neural network. We transformed any categorical data that we had into numerical data and tried our best to avoid skewness. In the next section the results are shown.
